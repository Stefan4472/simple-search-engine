# simple-search-engine

A search engine implementation written in plain Python. This project has peeled off of [Stefan's Blog](https://github.com/Stefan4472/Stefans-Blog).

For testing, this project uses the works of William Shakespeare, sourced from Project Guthenberg (https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100).
